                    An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with
                a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose. There are more 
                computers on this planet than there are people, and most of these computers are 
                single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. Embedded
                systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds 
                of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges,
                our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities
                of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained
                workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers. Embedded
                system is the one the leading technology. In todayâ€™s modern world we find 95% products
                are based on embedded systems. So the goal of Amplifier Electronics Pvt. Ltd. is to make
                embedded system easier for everyone and develop each product on embedded systems. So with
                this goal amplifier electronics has found in 2017, since that we are working hard to make
                product development affordable to everyone. We believe in to amplify your ambitions
