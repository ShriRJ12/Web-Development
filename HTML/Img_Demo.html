        <!--<pre> An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with
          a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose. There are more 
          computers on this planet than there are people, and most of these computers are 
          single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. Embedded
          systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds 
          of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges,
          our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities
          of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained
          workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers. Embedded
          system is the one the leading technology. In todayâ€™s modern world we find 95% products
          are based on embedded systems. So the goal of Amplifier Electronics Pvt. Ltd. is to make
          embedded system easier for everyone and develop each product on embedded systems. So with
          this goal amplifier electronics has found in 2017, since that we are working hard to make
          product development affordable to everyone. We believe in to amplify your ambitions..</pre>
